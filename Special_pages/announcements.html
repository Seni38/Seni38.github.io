I might start with JavaScript soon, I can learn CSS when needed anyways. however, I'm not planning on taking down this fun project but also not planning on adding more purely html related things anytime soon. I finished html (tutorial I used) but there's probably a lot more to it lol. I might continue learning CSS at some point but I want to focus on Javascript for the time being. </td>

	Note: I may change my mind and maybe I don't need to know CSS so I might stop learning CSS at any momentðŸ’€</td>
