1-8-2023: Added both "updates" and "contact" page. Both pages are a WIP, and the "contact" page is still being worked on.
Just like the entire "website" lol.
2-8-2023: Added some details on the "contact" page.
3-8-2023: Added some goofy text and calls it a dayðŸ’€
3-8-2023 second update: I decided because I was lazy
to make this page public the next day, but because I need to learn and not publish something
I already pre-made I decided to already add it, forcing me to continue learning tomorrowðŸ—¿
8-8-2023: Listen, my previous few days have been surprisingly busy alright? I'll work on this tomorrowðŸ—¿
(I blame timeblindness (why is this even a thing??) mental disorder smth)
13-8-2023: I will continue working on this tomorrow source: trust me bro (but I better will)
14-8-2023: I am currently working on this so I <small>did</small> keep my promise. might be tomorrow soon but we dont talk about that-ðŸ—¿
Update that followed after the recent... lets just call it a hotfix /j
But I added goofy text page. Have fun exploring it ig
22-8-2023: So I kinda lost motivationxD (:/)
don't expect much the following days because 1: new fortnite seasonðŸ‘€ (yes I still play fortnite) and 2: work exists and school begins to exist again:/ 
26-8-2023:
Added "main page revamp" which is basically main page but a bit changed with lists.
You can always check it out if you want to:>
26-8-2023:
Fixed some issues
27-8-2023:
Changed the revamped page a bit, let me know what you think of it lol
Also: I did some organising stuff and as I had to update every single path I might have missed a few, so if there are some 
links that leads to nowhere, can you please let me know? (never doing it again)
28-8-2023:
Previously main page has been replaced with the revamped main page.
I added the <a href="/Testing_pages/Table.html">Table</a> page and I fixed several issues related to the previous organising spree which I missed. Those were pretty minor tho.
29-8-2023:
Fixed the old main menu.
30-8-2023:
Added a <a href="/Testing_pages/Button_page.html" title="Button to the button page lol" type=""><button style="color:rgb(93, 102, 109); border-radius:20px; background-color:aliceblue">Button</button></a> page! 
Should I replace some links with buttons? :think:
