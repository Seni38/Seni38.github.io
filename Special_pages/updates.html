1-8-2023: Added both "updates" and "contact" page. Both pages are a WIP, and the "contact" page is still being worked on.
Just like the entire "website" lol.
2-8-2023: Added some details on the "contact" page.
3-8-2023: Added some goofy text and calls it a day💀
3-8-2023 second update: I decided because I was lazy
to make this page public the next day, but because I need to learn and not publish something
I already pre-made I decided to already add it, forcing me to continue learning tomorrow🗿
8-8-2023: Listen, my previous few days have been surprisingly busy alright? I'll work on this tomorrow🗿
(I blame timeblindness (why is this even a thing??) mental disorder smth)
13-8-2023: I will continue working on this tomorrow source: trust me bro (but I better will)
14-8-2023: I am currently working on this so I <small>did</small> keep my promise. might be tomorrow soon but we dont talk about that-🗿
Update that followed after the recent... lets just call it a hotfix /j
But I added goofy text page. Have fun exploring it ig
22-8-2023: So I kinda lost motivationxD (:/)
don't expect much the following days because 1: new fortnite season👀 (yes I still play fortnite) and 2: work exists and school begins to exist again:/ 
26-8-2023:
Added "main page revamp" which is basically main page but a bit changed with lists.
You can always check it out if you want to:>
26-8-2023:
Fixed some issues
27-8-2023:
Changed the revamped page a bit, let me know what you think of it lol
Also: I did some organising stuff and as I had to update every single path I might have missed a few, so if there are some 
links that leads to nowhere, can you please let me know? (never doing it again)
28-8-2023:
Previously main page has been replaced with the revamped main page.
I added the <a href="/Testing_pages/Table.html">Table</a> page and I fixed several issues related to the previous organising spree which I missed. Those were pretty minor tho.
29-8-2023:
Fixed the old main menu.
30-8-2023:
Added a <a href="/Testing_pages/Button_page.html" title="Button to the button page lol" type=""><button style="color:rgb(93, 102, 109); border-radius:20px; background-color:aliceblue">Button</button></a> page! 
Should I replace some links with buttons? :think:
31-8-2023:
Replaced some links with buttons. Should I make another re-design of the main page? Please let me know! (on Discord obviously lol)
I also fixed some oversichts.
3-9-2023 NOTE:
It was my birthday and stuff so I didn't get the time to add stuff. Resuming adding stuff tomorrow👍
6-9-2023 NOTE:
The past few days have been busy because school, work and me wasting my free time with gaming🗿
I'll work on this site this week, but mostlikely not tomorrow.
9-9-2023 NOTE:
As roblox is apparently coming to playstation I'm really considering to learning roblox lua and becomming a roblox dev.
I will continue learning HTML but at a slower pace (not that the last few days barely IF anything has been learned).
WHAT will this mean? I will basically continue my journey of learning html (and css) and eventually javascript BUT I will also learn
roblox lua and eventually other aspects like moddeling in order to become epic gamedev lol. Might convince my friends to join with me or sum idk🗿
but overall: it has me extremely motivated lol. Might spend less time grinding fortnite (save the world)🗿
So that's it for now, Of course I still have school and a job but I'm saving for a pc that can actually run something :>
10-9-2023:
I have added the <a href="announcements.html"><button style="border-radius:10px">announcements</button></a> page.
And as you might have noticed already, I changed the links to the special pages into buttons.
Note: the <a href="/Testing_pages/Table.html"><button style="border-radius:10px">Table</button></a> page might be vaulted soon/later on.
8-10-2023:
I replaced an incorrect sentence in the main page and fixed some mispelled list item tags. I wonder why I never noticed it.
I also added fighter to the Credits, reason: he exists 
Note: I haven't learned roblox lua dev, life is very busy and stuff and now I'm mainly focusing on html, css and possibly JavaScript,
Don't worry, I will definitely Touch it somewhere within the next 6 months🗿
