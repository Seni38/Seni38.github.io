1-8-2023: Added both "updates" and "contact" page. Both pages are a WIP, and the "contact" page is still being worked on.
Just like the entire "website" lol.
2-8-2023: Added some details on the "contact" page.
3-8-2023: Added some goofy text and calls it a dayðŸ’€
3-8-2023 second update: I decided because I was lazy
to make this page public the next day, but because I need to learn and not publish something
I already pre-made I decided to already add it, forcing me to continue learning tomorrowðŸ—¿
